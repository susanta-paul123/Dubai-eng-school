                <h2>Our Story</h2>
               <p> The English College, Dubai was established in 1992 and has grown into one of the most respected and highly sought-after British schools in Dubai and beyond. Initially established as a secondary school for Year 7 to Year 13 students only, 2005 saw the addition of The English College Primary school building for students from FS 1 to Year 6. Both being separate campuses initially, 2019 saw the merger of both the Primary and Secondary school to become an all-through Early Years to A-level British school, thus ensuring a smooth and seamless transition from FS 1 to Sixth Form.</p>
               <p>In August 2020, our architecturally ambitious and facility rich secondary g + 3 building opened its doors, featuring 8 Chemistry/ Physics/ Science/Bio Labs; Prep Rooms; Graphics Studio; Art Studio; Music Class Room; Individual Music Practice Rooms; Group Music Practice Room; Black Box Theatre; Drama Studio Theatre; large Library; Media Studies Room; Learning Commons; Dining Hall with Terrace; Sixth Form Study Rooms; Sixth Form Common Room. The new PE/Sports Complex features: Fitness Studio; separate Changing Rooms for Female and Male; modern, full equipped Clinic for Nurse and part-time Doctor; Activity/PE Classroom and large PE/Sports Hall.</p>
               <p>Following the British curriculum, all classes and lessons are taught and supported by our highly qualified and experienced teaching team. Our team regularly receive comprehensive professional development that contributes to our DSIB-rated “Very Good” Teaching and Learning. We have already embarked on the journey to make the transition from being rated among the very good British schools in Dubai to being among the outstanding British schools in Dubai.</p>
               <p>Great emphasis is placed on developing the whole child in a stimulating, caring environment. Excellent and strong relationships exist between staff, student and parents – something we are very proud of.</p>
